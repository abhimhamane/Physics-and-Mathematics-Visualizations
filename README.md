# Physics-and-Mathematics-Visualizations
Physics and Mathematics Visualizations made during Summer break of 2020 using Turtle, VPython and Manim Python Library.
This project was inspired from the work of Youtubers like 3Blue1Brown, TokyoEdTech and Coding Train.
I am now structuring the code written earlier and presenting in form of this GitHub Repo.
I will be adding new visualizations as and when I create new ones.
Initial ones are quite basic but still I am including them.

Rather than using turtle module using physics libraries such as pymunk or pygame would have been better.

Different visualizations divided into:
  -High School Physics
  
  -High School Mathematics
  
  -Advanced Physics
  
  -Advanced Mathematics







Feel Free to use any of the code and suggest improvements.
